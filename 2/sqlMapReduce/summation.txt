MapReduce job/steps for SQL:
SELECT groupfield, sum(fieldA) as mysum FROM "input.csv" GROUP BY groupfield

Input = input.csv
Filter = only focus on the groupfield data
Map() = get key and value for every data
Reduce() = get collection of how many of same key value pairs appear
Summation = can be done, if the data is a number type value then it can be the Number(key) * the value count(Number of appearences), If the data is of another form like sting then the count is good enough for a summation
Filter = Group the data as required + add mysum coloumn title ready for output
Output = Grouped data with summation
