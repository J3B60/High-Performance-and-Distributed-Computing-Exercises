MapReduce job/steps for SQL:
SELECT a.f1, b.f2 FROM "tbl1.csv" as a JOIN "tbl2.csv" as b ON a.id = b.id

Lets Assume that tbl1 a.id is PK(Primary Key) and b.id is FK(Foriegn Key)

Input1 = tbl1.csv
Filter = focus only on a.id
Map() = Data into key and value
Input2 - tbl2.csv
Filter = focus on b.id
Map() = Data into key and value
Reduce() = Collect key and values
Filter/Match = Match key values ok a.id to b.id
Output = Joined tbl1 and tbl2 via a.id and b.id (the full tables from input are actuall used, MapReduces only function is to match a.id to b.id (act as the glue))

*Note chain map and reduce

*Note map Phase can read in multiple files (though not used in these sqlMapReduce Tasks (I could have in Summation for less steps))
