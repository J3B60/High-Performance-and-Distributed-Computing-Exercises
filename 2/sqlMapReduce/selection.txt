MapReduce Jobs/Steps for SQL:
SELECT fieldA FROM "input.csx" WHERE fieldA == something

Input = input.csv
Filter = we are only interested in fieldA, not the whole table
Map() = each data has a key and value
Reduce() = each key and value is combined into a collection
Filter = now we are only interested in the data that match the specific key we want
Output = list of fieldA == something
