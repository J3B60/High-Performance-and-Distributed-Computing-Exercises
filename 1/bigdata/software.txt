5. Hadoop gave file and folder permissions, then issues with /input and /output which was changed to just input and output. This gave out an output folder showing what hadoop had done to the inputs and showing that the result was sucessful. There is a long wall of text in the terminal showing what it did. It did some map and reduce on the input.
6. Spark gave out a character count of the input as exxpected
7. Mongo just gave a string which looked like a key and some other lines.
